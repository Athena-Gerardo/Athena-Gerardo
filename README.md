# Hi, welcome to my GitHub Portfolio! <img src="dancing gif.gif" width="30" height="30"/>
I'm Athena, a meticulous and data-driven professional with a background in Physics.
My journey has been marked by a passion for unraveling insights from datasets and applying them to drive informed decision-making. Having recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, I have acquired the best tools and techniques in data analytics, such as R, SQL, Tableau, and Excel. 

I have a particular passion for native ecosystems and natural resource management. I would love to work on environmentally-focused projects one day. I am eager to bring my diverse experience and analytical skills to a dynamic team where I can contribute meaningfully to new projects!
